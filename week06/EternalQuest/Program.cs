// Program: Eternal Quest
// Author: Marco Sandoval
// Description: A gamified goal management system for tracking player progress. 
// Other files: Goal.cs, GoalManager.cs, SimpleGoal.cs, EternalGoal.cs, ChecklistGoal.cs
// Exceeding Requirements: When displaying a list of goals in the options: List Goals, and Record Event, Eternal Goals now appear with an infinity symbol (âˆž) next to them. The checkboxes now are also displayed when looking at what goal was accomplished during the Record Event process. I also implemented loading animations and pauses. Theres also error handling to keep the game experience smooth.

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        GoalManager manager = new GoalManager(); // Create an instance of GoalManager
        manager.Start(); // Start the goal management process. It will run until the user chooses to quit. This works because the Start method contains a loop that continues until the user selects the quit option.
